"""current goals include: 
1. DONE
2. Add more news options! (such as a news option that randomly boosts or drops multiple stocks at once)
3. allow players to buy things, like houses and cars and stuff
4. allow player to use things like crypto in a fluctuating market.
5. Create a way to see their Net Worth (their money in all even tied up in houses, cars, crypto, or stock)
6. make the list of stocks you own only show companies you have money in
7. When you check your stock portfolio, it should tell you if you are overall 
                                                    gaining or loosing money since your last check
                                                    
*IMPORTANT CHANGE I WANT TO MAKE WITH THE NEWS and other stuff*
    instead of having companies randomly go up and down the headlines should instead be like 
    'It is going to be A good week for _______' then instead of having "option 1." be check your money, 
    1 will instead be advance to next day, every day you make 10 dollars passively (which can be increased later)
    and the stock markets will randomly increase (or decrase depending on the headline) for that week and every 
    company will get a headline per (length of time), also the length of time should vary.
